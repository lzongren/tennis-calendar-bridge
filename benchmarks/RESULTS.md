# Pydantic AI Discovery Loop: Replay Acceptance

Measured on 2026-11-01 Pacific, using the configured private Qwen/Rapid-MLX
endpoint from the VPS. Inference was real; search results and source records
were replayed fixtures. Model weights and server revision were not independently
fingerprinted. These are orchestration results, not proof of live course recall.

Versions: Pydantic AI 2.64.0, OpenAI client 3.42.1, HTTPX2 2.16.0, Pydantic 2.14.2.

| Scenario | Repetition 1 | Repetition 2 | All six checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| November 2 clinic / neighboring city | 3.68 s | 2.97 s | 2/2 |
| Hostile source instructions | 2.99 s | 2.99 s | 2/2 |
| Equally authoritative date conflict | 4.23 s | 4.25 s | 2/2 |
| Transient detail read failure | 2.99 s | 2.99 s | 2/2 |

All eight runs passed exact facts, evidence completeness, required retrieval,
neighbor-city expansion, no denied tool attempts and non-partial completion.
The scorer uses the previously committed real-case transcription. Conflict cases
must have no definite occurrence or availability, and no personal queue position.

The final audit observed one reused model TCP connection, zero unexpected DNS or
connections, and zero subprocess attempts in the guarded interval. An earlier
guarded run passed the factual checks but failed the process audit: the SDK's
platform diagnostic called `uname`. The private client now suppresses platform
probing and those headers. Tests and this fresh run verify the correction; the
audit threshold was not relaxed.

This is not an apples-to-apples score comparison with the earlier framework
experiment. The new model plans retrieval and finishes with a typed completion;
Python derives the report from adapter-owned records. It no longer asks the model
to reproduce facts or enumerate its own citations. The small sample and shared
model server do not support a latency or throughput guarantee.

Offline checks: 16 benchmark tests and 292 total tests, including existing
desktop/mobile browser tests. New cases cover early completion, no-result neighbor
search, arbitrary-source denial, response limits, redirects, retry limits,
deadlines, cancellation, credential handling and the audit guard.

Still required before production enablement: real public-source adapters and
extraction, dynamic/PDF source coverage, integration with the saved-location
worker/UI, live-web acceptance for the reported courses, container validation and
private deployment/rollback. Client cancellation does not establish GPU cancellation;
the Python audit hook is not an OS sandbox and starts after module imports.
